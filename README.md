## User Stories (What it does)
- [x] User can access Rubicon through VScode editor 
- [x] User can write title and description for the project  
- [x] User can attach files and copy/paste code  
- [x] Jinja renders user input and renders it into to a formated documentation template 
- [x] Jinja's templates can be exported to html, or text files 

## How we built it  

## Challenges we ran into  
1. The first and most time consuming challenge was **building out the VSCode extension**. Neither of us have build extensions before yet because the whole point of our project is to give users the ability to write documentation **while  they code**, we couldnt give up. Most of all  it was challenging to work with Typescript + Webpack since none of us used Typescript before as well as the VSCode Webviews API's which have many functionalities that have to be researched.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
1. 
## What we learned  
 
## What's next for Rubicon  
For our next steps, we want to enhace and add on the following elements to Rubicon:
1. Add github authentication - this will add a layer of security as well as help to save the user's input
2. Connect Rubicon to a database so that all the files are saved  - this will allow the user to access previous or current templates
3. Allow the user to access saved templates through Rubicon's website
4. Allow user to pick a variety of Jinja templates - developers have different purposes when writing documentation , we want to tailor documentation to their goals

## How to run this extension locally: 
1. git clone "paste the link of the repo" 
2. Open VSCode and type "npm install" 
3. After instillation is done, press F5 to get a local VScode environment up & running ( the rubics cube icon is on the left)
